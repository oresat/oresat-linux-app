This program has been adapted from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's C language 
implementation of the CCSDS 122.0-B-2 Recommended Standard for Image Date Compression.
It has also been made to include code that allows binding to Python using pybind.

Please note header comments for each file, as we have attempted to adapt the 
source code to more modern capabilities while maintaining portability.

It should be possible to use the Makefile in the source directory to build the 
bpe program without incorporating the extra code used to bind it to Python.
